          A framework for understanding cybersecurity
          </h3>
          <div className="content">
            <p className="my-9">
            From a worker getting duped of $25M by deepfakes of his colleagues to Microsoft’s senior leadership & cybersecurity teams getting their emails stolen, it seems like there’s a new large scale security hack every month. One of the reasons for the uptick in cyber-attacks is that hackers have more attack vectors than ever before – phishing websites, social engineering, weak passwords, employee devices and many more. 

To keep up with attackers, the cybersecurity industry has come up with many acronyms that are useful for describing attack or defense mechanisms. If you have spent any time doing research in the space, you’ve heard of terms like SIEM, XDR, SOAR, SASE and CNAPP (just to name a few). If you are just learning about cybersecurity though, these terms can quickly become overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p className="my-9">
            In today’s interconnected world with a myriad of digital threats, it is important for every digital citizen to have a basic understanding of cybersecurity and how to protect their digital assets. However, complicated acronyms increase the barrier to entry for newcomers. What’s worse, these acronyms change to account for technology that continues to evolve at breakneck speed. For instance, a simple “antivirus” from yesteryear is now called “EDR”. 

One useful framework to make sense of the cybersecurity landscape is the Cyber Defense Matrix by Sounil Yu. It combines the 5 mutually exclusive functions from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (columns) with five distinct attack surfaces (rows) to capture most cybersecurity events.
            </p>
            <p className="my-9 text-#8A90A2">
            You will notice that Protect and Respond have similar implications except for one key difference – Protect looks at events from a technology-first viewpoint, while Respond is more people-heavy. This underlines a broader trend of the matrix – As we move from left to right, technology gives way to people as the key element in dealing with a cybersecurity event. As Wendy Nather writes in the foreword to the Cyber Defense Matrix, “The nouns will change every year, but the verbs will drift less.” How an attack occurs might change in the future, but what is being attacked broadly remains the same. Understanding the Cyber Defense Matrix is a great first step for a digital citizen to safely engage with an increasingly interconnected world.
