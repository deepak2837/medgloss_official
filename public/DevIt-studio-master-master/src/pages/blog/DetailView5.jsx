          Citizen data science developer
          </h3>
          <div className="content">
            <p className="my-9">
            My friend asked me today if I could explain the difference between development and coding in the IT industry. She was worried that it was a silly question to ask. It was not. The best way I could answer was the development that you do without coding is citizen development. It was unsurprising because I was in the middle of writing this piece. Citizen development might sound fancy. However, it is not yet a foolproof practice. It is believed that the primary advantage of someone being a citizen developer is him/her having a solid domain and industry knowledge while being able to use Low Code No Code (LCNC) platforms to develop business applications. Can I call them business technologists who bridge the gap between business understanding and technical acumen?
            </p>
            <p className="my-9">
            I have always believed that data science solutions can be better clustered by functions (departments) than by industries (domains). Marketing analytics, for example, remains more or less the same for finance or manufacturing industries (identifying the target audience for receiving a specific marketing communication). Call centre analytics rests on the same foundational approaches and use cases in all industries. I am not downplaying the role of domain knowledge in building analytics solutions. One cannot solve a problem without understanding how the industry and the organisation work. When discussing the development and implementation of data science solutions by citizen developers, we derive most of our confidence from the domain and function knowledge. 

I have always felt that business problems need to be addressed faster than the speed of IT development. I don’t mind speaking openly about the most common frustration of business teams towards the IT team. This is more so with data science teams because much of their work is experimental. Experiments fail, we learn, collect and prepare data again, rebuild ML models, and re-evaluate model performance. Finally, after the solution is implemented in the production environment, we discover that adoption is pathetic for various reasons (bad UI, resistance to change). How do we help ease the classic chicken/egg problem of ROI vs. adoption?

            In the Generative AI world, every content creator is a citizen content creator! My apologies if I sounded harsh. I have stopped quipping these days that I have come up with today’s TOI article “effortlessly”. They might assume I have used ChatGPT. Abstraction is a tricky thing. I call it Helps Loudly Kills Silently (HLKS). Abstraction hides the principles of coding, functions, parameter passing, variable declaration, classes, objects (instance of a class), methods, instance variables, loops, iterations, breaks and whatnot. Yes, ChatGPT helps. Yes, Google search helps. However, you should know what to look for and how good what you find is.
