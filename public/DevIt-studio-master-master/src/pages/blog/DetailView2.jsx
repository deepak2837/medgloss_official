          Global alignment on AI regulation– what’s the fuss about?
          </h3>
          <div className="content">
            <p className="my-9">
            Calls for artificial intelligence (AI) regulation have become trite; of course, we need regulation for AI, just like we need regulation for any other technology that has the potential to hurt humanity. And that regulation must cater to the interests of stakeholders globally, simply because we live in a globalised world, AI is a global technology, and interoperability across jurisdictions matters. So, what’s the fuss about? Well, this is where things get a little murky.

For starters, regulators and interest groups do not yet align on a common definition of “AI” to regulate it. However, this hasn’t kept them from getting into heated debates over the nature, scope, and urgency of AI-related risks and what technical and policy interventions are most critical for their mitigation. While some safety advocates claim that AI poses existential risks for humanity as they call for moratoriums and bans on AI innovation, others think such claims and proposals are misguided and could divert the scare regulatory resources from addressing the risks that AI poses in the here and now, like bias and misinformation.
            </p>
            <p className="my-9">
            Second, stakeholders continue to hold conflicting positions on several key policy questions around AI trust and safety. How should web scraping of personal and proprietary data for AI development be regulated? Who should own AI-generated artworks and inventions? How should liability be attributed for harm caused by an AI system? Is openness in AI development desirable? With the fears of catastrophic AI looming large, is government licensing a cure-all? How should countries and inter-governmental entities ensure the controlled use of lethal autonomous weapon systems? Is the environmental impact of AI concerning? If so, how should it be mitigated? If AI is going to take away jobs, how should corporations and countries make the AI transition in a way that reduces the economic strain on displaced workers? How should legislators decide what kind of AI use cases merit a blanket ban, what should be allowed only in restricted environments, and what should be relegated to voluntary self-regulation by the industry? How should global leaders ensure that AI development thrives on global inclusion rather than global inequities?
            </p>
            <p className="my-9 text-#8A90A2">
            World leaders need to balance any aspirations for AI supremacy with sustained international cooperation efforts to advance this critical agenda. Alongside other countries, India could play a key role in this effort by leveraging its presidency of the Global Partnership on AI as well as the unique geopolitical importance it holds to the innovation and regulatory powerhouses of the world – the United States and European Union respectively.
