    disease: "Diabetes",
    background: "A 57-year-old male with a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes presented with persistent hyperglycemia despite being on maximum doses of oral hypoglycemic agents. The patient had developed peripheral neuropathy and early signs of nephropathy. Previous attempts at managing the condition with standard protocols had failed to achieve target glucose levels.",
    methods: "We implemented a multifaceted approach combining a modified insulin regimen, GLP-1 receptor agonist, lifestyle intervention program, and continuous glucose monitoring. The patient underwent weekly monitoring for the first month, followed by bi-weekly consultations for the subsequent two months.",
    results: "After six months, the patient showed significant improvement with HbA1c decreasing from 9.8% to 6.7%. Neuropathic symptoms improved, and kidney function stabilized. The patient reported increased energy levels and quality of life measures showed marked improvement across all domains.",
    conclusion: "This case demonstrates the effectiveness of a personalized, combination approach to managing treatment-resistant diabetes. The synergistic effect of carefully selected pharmacological agents, alongside structured lifestyle modifications and close monitoring, resulted in outcomes that exceeded those typically achieved with conventional approaches.",

    subject: "Neurosurgery",
    disease: "Glioblastoma",
    background: "A 45-year-old female with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme was referred after two previous conventional surgeries followed by standard chemoradiation therapy. The tumor had recurred in a location previously deemed inoperable due to its proximity to critical language and motor areas.",
    methods: "Using advanced intraoperative mapping techniques and a novel minimally invasive approach, we performed awake craniotomy with continuous neuropsychological testing. The procedure incorporated fluorescence-guided resection with 5-ALA and intraoperative MRI to maximize tumor removal while preserving functional tissue.",
    results: "We achieved 94% tumor resection without any new neurological deficits. Post-operative recovery was significantly faster than with previous conventional surgeries. At 12-month follow-up, the patient showed no signs of progression and maintained excellent quality of life with a Karnofsky Performance Score of 90."
